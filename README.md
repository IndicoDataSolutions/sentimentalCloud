pyTagTweets
===========

Create a real-time tag cloud of tweets given a query

## Sentiment analysis coloration:

to produce a wordcloud with word color produced from sentiment analysis, pytagcloud's sourcecode needs to be edited. `__init__.py` includes the relevent function to be edited, `make_tags()`. 
one possible edit to give sentiment-based coloration is given in the pytagcloud branch found [here](https://github.com/IndicoDataSolutions/PyTagCloud/tree/ruby/wordcloud).
